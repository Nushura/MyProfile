<h2 style="background-color:Violet;">~Introduction~</h2>
<br><br>
<p>  Hello everyone! I am Nushura Islam, people call me Nush. A student at rmit university and
studying on Bachelors of Information Technology(IT).
<br><br>

<br><br>
<h2 style="background-color:Violet;">~Some facts about me~</h2>

<br><br>
<p>  I am from Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. It's a small country but is known for having the world's largest Bay called
The Bay of Bengal. I had my education from a English medium school called Scholastica. Then during my grade 12 I moved to Australia at
2019, for my foundation studies at RMIT University which I completed just recently. Now I am currently studying Bachelors of IT at
RMIT as well. I can speak 3 languages, Bangla(native language),English and Hindi. My hobbies are to play badminton, art and dance, which
I am really passionate about. </p>
<br><br>
<h2 style="background-color:Violet;">~Interest in IT~</h2>

<br><br>
<p>  Nowadays, IT is a demandable subject as the job market of it is really broad throughout the world. In my opinion, IT is a really interesting
subject to study on as I am and will be getting to know about many aspects of it's world, relating to the use of computers and etc.
There is no particular thing that I like about IT yet but I am still learning. Honestly, I do not know much about it but as I get to
learn more, my interests keeps on rising. You might be wondering then that how come I have interest in IT if I do not know much
about it, right? Well, when I was on my high school, I often used to get worried thinking about what subject should I pursue my higher education on.
I could not think of anything but until later at a point I realized that I was actually interested in getting to know and understand
about how the computing world works. Earlier there were many discussions happening between my family members and I, about my higher
education and finally I could come into a conclusion that I should study IT. The person who helped me come to that conclusion were my
siblings as they could understand what will be truly the best for me. </p>
<br><br>
<p>  There are many students who dreams of attending certain universities and in the same way I have dreamt of attending RMIT.
RMIT is a reputational institution and is know for it's excellence in education. This university not only provides knowledge to their
students but it prepares students for the job world as well, by providing hands on experience. RMIT also have job shops which gives students
the opportunity to develop their skills needed for meeting the requirements for getting a job. Job shops has links and can also help finding jobs.
RMIT is a great place to create connections through various ways. For instance, they have many clubs, through which you can get to meet new people and
some of them may also turn into your good friends. These are the reasons why I choose RMIT for my higher education degree on IT.</p>
<br><br>
<p>  Most of the time there are expectations by students when they start studying at any instituition. I have certain expectations as well.
Firstly, I want to gain knowledge which I can implement in my future career and as I am studying IT, there will be many things which I
can implement in my future jobs. Secondly, I expect to gain hands-on experience. Lastly, I want to build my people skills so that it can
enhance my communication skill. This is possible by different group assignments. In addition to that, this is what many firms look for while
hiring their employees.</p>
<br><br>
<h2 style="background-color:Violet;">~Ideal Job~</h2>

<br><br>

<br><br>
<p>  In my opinion ideal job is something that will motivate you to work every day. If it is something that makes everyday a misery for you then
it should not be called ideal. It obviously may need a lot of time for an individual to know about what they are truly passionate about but however,
currently, I feel like my ideal job is to become a software developer. I feel like the job advertisement mentioned above is ideal for me.
It is a software developers position in the company name 'Genisys Australia', located at Sydney(CBD). It's a full time job with an income of
$70,000 per annum. This role seemed appealing to me because I actually want to develop a software someday and this position will be a learning
opportunity for me to understand each sector of the development process. This position involves carrying out many projects involving the growth
of a software. Moreover, it will need people skills for gathering proper information about the product which means there will be collaboration.
In addition to that, the manager will be there to guide us through. Hence, it would be a wonderful opportunity for me to learn the different stages
of a software development.</p>
<br><br>
<p>  If you want a job somewhere, you can not just have it with whatever qualification you have, right? 'Genisys Australia' has certain requirements as
well. The employee must have a degree related to software development. They must also have prior experience of few years in working on projects
related with software development, must have good communication skills so that they can talk with their stakeholders and so that they are content with the
service they are getting, must have knowledge about few coding languages and Relational Database Management Systems. </p>
<br><br>
<p>  However, I still do not have a solid knowledge about these requirements yet but just the basics. I need to know more in detail about the
coding languages and Relational Database Management Systems. I will gain more knowledge about those by the time I will be finishing my degree.
As I am still on the process of getting an IT degree so, at first I will need to finish the degree and then with few extra years of experience on
working under software development, I will be eligible for working at 'Genisys Australia'. Moreover, I am good at communicating so I believe that
communicating with customers will not be an issue but there is always room for development. So, I will have to try to improve my communication skills
as well by doing part time works where I have to deal with consumers.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:Violet;">~Personal Profile~</h2>

<br><br>
<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/ffa37bf0b0e8c">1. Myer-Briggs Type Indicator(MBTI) test result</a> <br>
<a href="https://personalitymax.com/report/?ls=64-56-56&name_key=04c96c4f21">2. Learning style test result</a> <br>
<a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/results.php?r=3.4,2.8,3.8,3.9,3.4#_IV">3. Big Five Personality test result</a> <br>
<br><br>

<p>  These kind of online tests are used by the people who hire so that they can get an overview of the type of employees they will be taking into their
teams. I have taken three tests as mentioned above. Even though you actually can not get to know a person by just going through their online tests but it still
shows some aspects of them. By taking those tests I discovered some of my own characteristics as well and some of which I actually did not even realize before
that I had it in me. When I apply for a job and if they ask for some particular online test results then they can understand if I am capable of working in their
firm or not. I feel like in that way the hiring process can be efficient. So, for me, these tests can, not only be beneficial for getting a job, but it helped me by
pointing out my strengths and weaknesses as well.</p>
<br><br>
<p>  The results of these kind of tests can illustrate your behaviour and its influence while working in a team. My results showed that I am friendly, careful,
enthusiastic, organized, open-minded and curious which are actually true. My friendly nature can spread a good vibe among other team members which might
make working together a fun experience as they can be comfortable and can open up more. While working in a team we should be mindful that everyone will contribute
different kind of ideas. So, being curious and an enthusiastic person, I can be open to gain new ideas and collaborate but I am careful as well which might prevent
any sort of clashes from occurring. However, the way we behave can depend heavily on the group members as well because if most of them are
not contributing their efforts properly then it might cause pressure and disturbance within a group. Therefore, communicating properly and taking actions when
something is going wrong is the key.</p>
<br><br>
<p>  When forming a team I should consider my test results. Firstly, the team should contain individuals who are willing to work as I have encountered those kind
of situations where there were people who liked to just sit around and make others do the work. Secondly, I like to follow a structured plan to stay organized.
So, I would like to form a team with those group of people who would like to make a plan first and then follow the steps accordingly. In addition to that,
staying organized by having a plan means having to finish the task on time or beforehand. This brings me to the last point which I need to consider before forming
a team, that is a group of people who do not wait for the deadline to come close in order to start the task. Therefore, these are the things I want to take into
account while forming a group. </p>
<br><br>
<h2 style="background-color:Violet;">~Project Idea~</h2>

<br><br>
<p>  I have always been passionate about fashion or the fashion world. Thus, merging the fashion world with the IT industry seems like an intriguing idea to me.
I want to develop a smartphone app about styling closets which will combine both the fashion world and the IT industry. This project is about a closet styling
app where the app will contain all the items in one's closet. It can create different combinations of outfits within what an individual has. The app will give
suggestions about other clothes as well. Moreover, it will include the method of keyword research and classified ads which will be explained in more details on
later sections. </p>
<br><br>
<p>  This application's main target audience are those people who is cautious about their outfits or even other individuals who are interested in fashion and
clothes. There are many people who stays too busy to select a good outfit for everyday events but they want to look nice too. They eventually have to select
something, so this application can come handy to them and make their life a bit easier by styling their outfit. It will also show the stakeholders those products
which they were looking for or products, similar in taste, to those in their own closet as well. This increases their chances of reaching out to those products
which they like.</p>
<br><br>
<p>  An application which contains personalized closet plus closet suggestion, just think how easier life will get for people who spends quite a lot of time
everyday styling their clothes. As I have mentioned above, this app will create outfits from using the clothes an individual already has within their collection.
The clothes have to be inputted by the user into the system. Data of those collections will be analyzed by the app and more resources will be provided to the
user in terms of that, so they can explore more similar clothes, of similar taste. Moreover, keyword research will be used by the app. So, it has to connect with
other sort of search engines present inside the smartphone. </p>
<br><br>
<p>  On apps like Facebook or Instagram, they use keyword research and show classified advertisements, in order to show suggestions to the users in terms of what
they search on other search engines. Those search engines does not only include web browsers but also what they search on other shopping apps available in their
phone. For  example AliExpress, eBay, amazon or etc. Therefore, in my app I want to input this feature done by Facebook or Instagram. However, who likes to see ads?
Nobody, right? I do not know about what others feel like, but I just hate it when the similar advertisements keep on coming up on my feed all the time. Therefore,
my app will be programmed in such a way that it will use the keyword research in order to get the data from the classified advertisement and then, it will analyze
the data to show those or related products but without repetition. So, in this way the user will not get annoyed by seeing the same products repeatedly but those
will be shown like it is there normal feed. Below each product, information will be provided so that if the consumer wills then they can find their source from
which they will be able to purchase it. So, this app will connect with many other platforms and create a form of connection between producers and consumers.
Therefore, providing a huge platform where people can get their own electronic closet to see all of their clothes in one place and personalized
outfits. In addition to that, a place where people can explore clothes which are all personalized based on an individual's own taste and fashion and can even purchase
those products which are not on their closet.</p>
<br><br>
<p>  To build this application there are some special equipment needed. For designing the user interface 'Flutter' needs to be used which is an open-source tool.
It is a new language created by Google. This is an efficient language as it can be used on both IOS and Android so it can work in multi-platforms. The back-end,
which refers to the code behind the design, will be coded by Google Firebase and rest API(Application Programming Interface). API acts like the middleman
between two or more platforms that lets all of them to communicate. For the e-commerce site (shopping site), connections will be made between the back end of
the software with the API of multi e-commerce sites or online shopping platforms. This is where the app specializes using the connections with the API used to
fetch information on deals and suggestions using the data inputted by the user in the application. </p>
<br><br>
<p>  To carry out this project there are skills that are required. The language called 'Flutter', Google Firebase and rest API needs to be learnt and understood.
In the business aspect the knowledge of e-commerce site needs to be there too. There should be a proper plan in order to carry out each and every little tasks.
Prototypes will be made so that user feedback can be taken from those and updates can be made. User feedback is a vital part because they will be the one's to
use the app. Moreover, including these points there are many other aspects as well which needs to be considered but this project is quite feasible.</p>
<br><br>
<p>  In conclusion, if this project is successful then it will create a huge platform where there can be a lot of collaboration. It will give the consumers a wide
variety of clothes option to choose from and all of which are in their own taste of fashion. They can get to see their favourite products all in one place. It
can even save a lot of time of people who stays too busy to plan their outfits every day. Overall, it can benefit fashion-oriented people in many ways.</p>
